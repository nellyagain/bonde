# R:R Target Realism Audit — 2026-05-17

*v4.13.7 — V5.9 target regex fix on top of v4.13.6 baseline (regex disambiguation only; audit logic unchanged).*

*RR_TARGET_AUDIT_MONITORING_ONLY*

## 1. Purpose

This is a measurement-only report. It does not change trading rules, action labels, A2/B+ eligibility, or the maturity-gated rule-change logic. The audit tests whether planned R:R values from the V5.9.7 actionability skill are realistic in practice by comparing them against actual price action and structural resistance (200 SMA).

> This audit is partial monitoring only until enough forward bars exist. PENDING_INSUFFICIENT_DATA rows must not be interpreted as failures. Do not change rules from this audit alone.

## 2. Maturity Status

No rows in audit universe.

## 3. Summary

_No audit rows produced._

## 4. A2 Audit (all / triggered-only / not-triggered)

_No rows._

> **View arithmetic note:** ALL ≥ TRIGGERED_ONLY + NOT_TRIGGERED. Rows where `triggered_flag` is unresolved (NaN — typically `PENDING_INSUFFICIENT_DATA` before the 5d window matures) appear in ALL but in neither subset. The difference equals the count of trigger-pending rows.

## 4b. B+ Audit (by blocker type)

_No rows._

## 5. Setup-family Audit

_No rows._

## 6. Resistance Audit (by nearest_resistance_type)

_No rows._

## 7. Top Warning Rows (computed_planned_rr ≥ 2.0 but effective or actual < 2.0)

_No rows._

## 8. Missing-field Diagnostics

- decision_outcomes_source: MISSING — no in-memory frame and CSV not found; audit is empty.
- skill_pack_candidate_outcomes_source: MISSING — sma_200/close fields will be NaN; 200SMA resistance audit will collapse to NONE.

Notes on schema gaps in v4.13.7:
- `prior_high` is not pre-computed; nearest_resistance considers 200SMA only. The RR_OVERSTATED_BY_NEAREST_RESISTANCE flag is retained for forward compatibility but currently duplicates the SMA200 flag. A future patch can add prior-high derivation.
- `gap_fill_destroyed_rr`: NaN universally in v4.13.7. This metric requires trigger-day open/fill data, which is not preserved in current enriched outputs. Reserved for a future patch when intraday fill data is added.
- `actual_entry_rr` uses `trigger_price` as the fill proxy when triggered (not gap-aware). Mathematically equal to `computed_planned_rr` for triggered rows in v4.13.7 — a true gap-fill comparison requires intraday data.
- `target_hit_before_stop_5d` is set to UNKNOWN universally; daily bars do not resolve intraday order.
- Non-triggered rows have NaN R-multiples and hit flags by design. Signal-level fields (max_high_Nd, min_low_Nd, computed_planned_rr, effective_rr, target_realism_flag) remain populated for monitoring.

## 9. Interpretation Guidance

- Do not change rules from this report alone.
- Use this audit to diagnose whether A2 problems come from **target realism** rather than from selection alone.
- Rule changes require repeated mature evidence in the weekly cohort report, not partial monitoring.
- Triggered-only views are the primary read for trade quality. A2 rows that never triggered should not be counted as failed trades.
- Partial rows are monitoring-only; PENDING_INSUFFICIENT_DATA rows are not failures.

*No trading-rule recommendation is emitted from this audit.*
