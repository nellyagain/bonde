# Bonde Learning Loop Executive Digest — 2026-05-17

_Primary review artifact. Use the underlying CSVs only when a specific number needs audit._
_Run timestamp: 2026-05-17 12:22 UTC_

## 1. Today's required action
1. **No rule changes.** (§9 hypothesis tracker / verdict gates — all monitoring-only, no SUPPORTED verdicts)
2. **Wait for SLINGSHOT future bars.** Earliest T+5 maturity: **2026-05-22**. (§13)
3. **Watch A1/A2 zero-TRADE issue.** Confirm whether A1 is intentionally rare or unreachable and whether clean A1/A2 rows are over-routed. (§6)
4. **Track KK confirmation.** H_KK_CONFIRMATION is now pre-registered and measurement-only; do not hard-gate Bonde rows from KK yet. (§9)
5. **Track Sugar Babies OOS.** Current signal is context-only / overlay-not-rule-evidence. (§14)
6. **Check realized P&L once `n_with_realized_r >= 30`.** Current n = **0**. (§15)

## 2. Changed since last run — prior run → 2026-05-17 12:22 UTC
- Prior digest date: **not available**
- Current digest date: **2026-05-17**
- Comparison window: **prior run → 2026-05-17**

### Pipeline changes
- SLINGSHOT decision-log target/R:R backfill: no new backfilled rows detected in this run.
- Tiny-geometry hygiene audit active: no tiny-geometry rows flagged.
- Dedup diagnostics active: no full-plan+price rows yet.
- Backfill source attribution simplified to `slingshot_backfill_source` enum.
- KK confirmation research layer added: `H_KK_CONFIRMATION` computes cohorts in the learning loop without changing upstream signals.

### Data changes
- No new hypothesis verdicts crossed a rule-change threshold.
- No Day-1 shape verdicts crossed threshold.
- Realized P&L remains sample-immature: `n_with_realized_r` = **0**.

### Open follow-ups carried forward
- ACLX 4-row diagnostic appearance: visible in dedup diagnostics; not a trading-rule issue.
- Float-precision drift in tiny-geometry flags across sources: known, low materiality; use tolerance-aware comparisons.
- SLINGSHOT `OK_EVALUABLE` rows remain 0 until future bars mature.

## 3. Operational status
- Master decision log missing or empty. Review cannot be trusted until ingestion is fixed.

## 4. Executive interpretation
Current loop status: **operationally healthy, evidence still immature**. This digest is monitoring context, not rule-change permission.
1. No rule changes are authorized from this digest. Use it to prioritize investigations and council context only.

## 5. Key findings from current data
- Setup-family performance summary unavailable.
- Actionability summary unavailable.

## 6. A1 / A2 executable-signal health
Purpose: check whether the actionability layer is producing true executable candidates or routing everything to council/watch.
- A1/A2 routing counts unavailable because `action_label` is missing from the master decision log.
### Current interpretation
- No A1/A2 routing anomaly detected by the digest generator.
### Council A1/A2 reachability audit
- Source: `council_reachability_audit_*.csv` from the Council skill. Diagnostic only; does not change labels or trading rules.
| A1_REACHABLE   | A2_EXECUTABLE_REACHABLE   | ZERO_TRADE_CAUSE        |   n_A1 |   n_A2 |   n_TRADE |   n_A2_to_COUNCIL |
|:---------------|:--------------------------|:------------------------|-------:|-------:|----------:|------------------:|
| NOT_EVALUABLE  | NOT_EVALUABLE             | INSUFFICIENT_CLEAN_ROWS |      0 |      0 |         0 |                 0 |

- Latest reachability audit source: `/content/bonde_repo/.claude/skills/llm-council/reports/council_reachability_audit_2026-05-15-spir-wrby-r4.csv`
- Top Council demotion reasons from latest audit:
| demotion_reason   |   rows |
|:------------------|-------:|
| rr_floor_fail     |      2 |
| UNKNOWN           |      1 |

- Interpretation: zero-TRADE appears driven by candidate quality/availability, not necessarily a Council routing bug.
### A1/A2 forward-return slices
- No A1/A2 performance slices surfaced in `actionability_performance_summary_v410.csv`.
### Caveats
- T+5 forward return is ticker-path evidence, not Kevin's realized P&L.
- Stops, skipped trades, council deferrals, and actual user execution are not reflected in raw T+5 close-to-close returns.
- A2 rows routed to COUNCIL are marginal by design; they should not be treated as clean executable A2 evidence.
- If A1 remains absent post-V5.9.19, test whether criteria are intentionally rare or unreachable.

## 7. EP9M overlay
- EP9M setup-family row unavailable in the current setup-family summary.
- Corpus audit EP9M setup-family rows raw → normalized → master: **0 → 0 → 0**.
- Corpus audit EP9M context rows in master: **0**.
- Interpretation: EP9M did not enter the current decision-log corpus as a setup-family row. If a prior digest showed EP9M, inspect `decision_log_discovery_audit_latest.md` for excluded files or changed source scope.

## 8. Action-label / reject-vs-watch inversion watchlist
- No adjacent-label inversion with both sides n>=20 and lower-label avg return > higher-label avg by at least 1 percentage point.

## 9. Hypothesis tracker / verdict gates
These are pre-registered monitoring slots, not a roadmap and not rule-change permission. They exist so July does not become passive waiting: the loop tracks OOS rows daily while preserving evidence discipline.

- Hypothesis tracker report: `hypothesis_tracker_latest.md`
- ACTIVE_BURST Gate6 shadow candidates: **0** rows in `active_burst_gate6_shadow_candidates_v41328.csv`
- Guardrail: shadow candidates are review/tradeability audit rows only. They do not change `final_trade_status`, action label, ranking, R:R, or hard-reject behavior.
### Pre-registered verdict gates
These gates are binding review criteria. A rule patch should not ship unless its hypothesis has a pre-registered SUPPORTED verdict or a separate explicitly documented emergency bug rationale.

### KK confirmation study
Research-only: tests whether Bonde anticipation rows with KK leadership-quality confirmation outperform Bonde anticipation rows without KK confirmation. This does not alter trading labels, ranking, R:R, or hard gates.
**Operational definition:** `kk_research_confirmation = kk_extend_score >= 70 AND (kk_leadership_score >= 70 OR kk_group_strength_score >= 50) AND all KK hard-disqualifier flags are false except kk_pause_too_long. kk_low_price_for_extension remains a disqualifier.`
**OOS semantics:** current counts are cumulative mature evidence; OOS counts are strict `signal_date >= 2026-05-17` mature evidence.
**Realistic review timing:** earliest likely verdict review is late July–mid September 2026, depending on confirmed-row accumulation and T+5/T+10/T+20 maturity.
- KK confirmation tracker did not run or found no base cohort. Put `bonde_kk_final_decision_*.csv` and the canonical skill-pack/anticipation files into the one-inbox or inputs folder, then rerun.
- Pre-registered action: if SUPPORTED, use KK only as a Layer 5 priority/confidence signal; if REJECTED, keep KK diagnostics but stop using it for Layer 5 confirmation.
### Hypothesis discipline meta-rules
- Maximum active WATCHING hypotheses: **7**. Current pre-registered hypotheses: **7**.
- New hypotheses should not be added unless one existing hypothesis closes as `SUPPORTED`, `REJECTED`, or `AMBIGUOUS`, or unless there is a separately documented emergency/data-capture rationale. KK confirmation is the documented data-capture exception: without capturing cohorts now, the next 8–12 weeks would not answer the question.
- After a `SUPPORTED` hypothesis ships a patch, no new hypothesis from the same family should be opened for **90 days** unless there is an emergency bug rationale.
- If `H_REALIZED_PNL_CORRELATION` returns `REJECTED`, all signal-rule patches pause until execution / selection quality is reviewed.
- These meta-rules are designed to prevent hypothesis creep and post-hoc rule changes while OOS evidence matures.

## 10. ACTIVE_BURST Gate-6 Observational Watchlist
Rows in this section remain `REJECT` in the decision log. This is an observational research/watchlist section only; it does not alter `final_trade_status`, action labels, ranking, R:R, or hard-reject behavior.
- Full shadow candidates: **0**
- Tradeability-review watchlist rows: **0**
- Context-only rows excluded for missing trigger/invalidation: **0**
- Output file: `active_burst_gate6_observational_watchlist_latest.md`
- Source shadow CSV: `active_burst_gate6_shadow_candidates_v41328.csv`
- Required manual check: only consider these for live attention if they have a defensible trigger, invalidation, R:R, liquidity, DTE safety, and no hard reject.
_No Gate6 observational rows found in this run._

## 12. Day-1 shape diagnostics
Compact executive view. Full coverage/verdict tables remain in the Day-1 audit CSV/markdown outputs.
- Day-1 coverage file unavailable.

## 13. SLINGSHOT diagnostics / evaluability audit
- SLINGSHOT diagnostic rows unavailable.

## 14. Sugar Babies overlay
- Sugar Babies overlay summary unavailable. Confirm `sugar_babies.csv` is visible to Colab.

## 15. Realized P&L attribution
- Status: **wired but no realized trade data ingested yet**.
- Drop a raw IBKR/broker CSV into `bonde_learning/_inbox/` using a name like `ibkr_trades_YYYY-MM-DD.csv`, `broker_trades_YYYY-MM-DD.csv`, or `executions_YYYY-MM-DD.csv`. The notebook will infer signal date, join system context, and compute realized R where stop/risk is available. No manual R sheet is required.
- This is the next major validation step if the system is already making money: connect signal quality to actual realized R/P&L.

### Resolved since last run
- None auto-detected.
- Persistent queue files: `investigation_queue_latest.csv`, `investigation_queue_history_latest.csv`

## 17. Open caveats / next actions
- No major open caveats detected by the digest generator; still apply weekly maturity discipline before changing rules.

## 18. Evidence discipline
- This digest is monitoring context, not permission to change rules.
- Rule-change evidence should come from weekly cohorts with mature T+5/T+10/T+20 windows and repeated effects across cohorts.
- `final_trade_status` remains the executable decision field; `tier` is dashboard/source context only.
- EP9M, KK confirmation, and Sugar Babies may inform review priority only after validated; none can override R:R, DTE, hard rejects, failed EP, bag-holder status, dilution/offering, or bad data.
